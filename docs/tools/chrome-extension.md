# Chrome extension (browser relay)

The openx Chrome extension lets the agent control your **existing Chrome tabs** (your normal Chrome window) instead of launching a separate clawd-managed Chrome profile.

Attach/detach happens via a **single Chrome toolbar button**.

## What it is (concept)

There are three parts:
- **Browser control service** (Gateway or node): the API the agent/tool calls (via the Gateway)
- **Local relay server** (loopback CDP): bridges between the control server and the extension (`http://127.0.0.1:18792` by default)
- **Chrome MV3 extension**: attaches to the active tab using `chrome.debugger` and pipes CDP messages to the relay

openx then controls the attached tab through the normal `browser` tool surface (selecting the right profile).

## Install / load (unpacked)

1) Install the extension to a stable local path:

```bash
openx browser extension install
```

2) Print the installed extension directory path:

```bash
openx browser extension path
```

3) Chrome â†?`chrome://extensions`
- Enable â€œDeveloper modeâ€?- â€œLoad unpackedâ€?â†?select the directory printed above

4) Pin the extension.

## Updates (no build step)

The extension ships inside the openx release (npm package) as static files. There is no separate â€œbuildâ€?step.

After upgrading openx:
- Re-run `openx browser extension install` to refresh the installed files under your openx state directory.
- Chrome â†?`chrome://extensions` â†?click â€œReloadâ€?on the extension.

## Use it (no extra config)

openx ships with a built-in browser profile named `chrome` that targets the extension relay on the default port.

Use it:
- CLI: `openx browser --browser-profile chrome tabs`
- Agent tool: `browser` with `profile="chrome"`

If you want a different name or a different relay port, create your own profile:

```bash
openx browser create-profile \
  --name my-chrome \
  --driver extension \
  --cdp-url http://127.0.0.1:18792 \
  --color "#00AA00"
```

## Attach / detach (toolbar button)

- Open the tab you want openx to control.
- Click the extension icon.
  - Badge shows `ON` when attached.
- Click again to detach.

## Which tab does it control?

- It does **not** automatically control â€œwhatever tab youâ€™re looking atâ€?
- It controls **only the tab(s) you explicitly attached** by clicking the toolbar button.
- To switch: open the other tab and click the extension icon there.

## Badge + common errors

- `ON`: attached; openx can drive that tab.
- `â€¦`: connecting to the local relay.
- `!`: relay not reachable (most common: browser relay server isnâ€™t running on this machine).

If you see `!`:
- Make sure the Gateway is running locally (default setup), or run a node host on this machine if the Gateway runs elsewhere.
- Open the extension Options page; it shows whether the relay is reachable.

## Remote Gateway (use a node host)

### Local Gateway (same machine as Chrome) â€?usually **no extra steps**

If the Gateway runs on the same machine as Chrome, it starts the browser control service on loopback
and auto-starts the relay server. The extension talks to the local relay; the CLI/tool calls go to the Gateway.

### Remote Gateway (Gateway runs elsewhere) â€?**run a node host**

If your Gateway runs on another machine, start a node host on the machine that runs Chrome.
The Gateway will proxy browser actions to that node; the extension + relay stay local to the browser machine.

If multiple nodes are connected, pin one with `gateway.nodes.browser.node` or set `gateway.nodes.browser.mode`.

## Sandboxing (tool containers)

If your agent session is sandboxed (`agents.defaults.sandbox.mode != "off"`), the `browser` tool can be restricted:

- By default, sandboxed sessions often target the **sandbox browser** (`target="sandbox"`), not your host Chrome.
- Chrome extension relay takeover requires controlling the **host** browser control server.

Options:
- Easiest: use the extension from a **non-sandboxed** session/agent.
- Or allow host browser control for sandboxed sessions:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      sandbox: {
        browser: {
          allowHostControl: true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then ensure the tool isnâ€™t denied by tool policy, and (if needed) call `browser` with `target="host"`.

Debugging: `openx sandbox explain`

## Remote access tips

- Keep the Gateway and node host on the same tailnet; avoid exposing relay ports to LAN or public Internet.
- Pair nodes intentionally; disable browser proxy routing if you donâ€™t want remote control (`gateway.nodes.browser.mode="off"`).

## How â€œextension pathâ€?works

`openx browser extension path` prints the **installed** on-disk directory containing the extension files.

The CLI intentionally does **not** print a `node_modules` path. Always run `openx browser extension install` first to copy the extension to a stable location under your openx state directory.

If you move or delete that install directory, Chrome will mark the extension as broken until you reload it from a valid path.

## Security implications (read this)

This is powerful and risky. Treat it like giving the model â€œhands on your browserâ€?

- The extension uses Chromeâ€™s debugger API (`chrome.debugger`). When attached, the model can:
  - click/type/navigate in that tab
  - read page content
  - access whatever the tabâ€™s logged-in session can access
- **This is not isolated** like the dedicated clawd-managed profile.
  - If you attach to your daily-driver profile/tab, youâ€™re granting access to that account state.

Recommendations:
- Prefer a dedicated Chrome profile (separate from your personal browsing) for extension relay usage.
- Keep the Gateway and any node hosts tailnet-only; rely on Gateway auth + node pairing.
- Avoid exposing relay ports over LAN (`0.0.0.0`) and avoid Funnel (public).
